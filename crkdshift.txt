# Crooked/Shift

'''
Crooked/Shift ('journal' from here on) is an online literary journal focused on short stories, flash fiction, and essays. 
Featured genres include horror, pulp, existential, realism, kafka; really, anything could be printed.
We want to give unpublished and seasoned writers alike an opportunity to compose relaxed, and unpretentious manuscripts. Writers who are writing for themselves. Things that get lost in the shuffle. Tschotske.

NO: Novellas or novel excerpts.
MAYBE: Good prose poetry and poems (the latter very infrequently, so we can stay focused).
